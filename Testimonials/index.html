                            <p>Ivan has been one of the best massage therapists I've experienced. He is friendly, listens well and most importantly has a very intuitive touch to address my areas of concern. He's done wonders for my headaches, low back pain and other areas that need my attention. He is the consummate professional, easy to do business with and I would recommend him without any hesitation to others.</p><cite>Richard L.</cite></blockquote>

                            <p>Ivan is a gifted massage therapist. His experience working in a PT environment, and as an amateur athlete, have raised his good instincts in applying massage techniques. He gives a wonderfully relaxing spa massage, and is equally capable of delivering relief from muscle tension arising from exercise, injury or posture issues. After years of competing as an equestrian, I have the body of “an old rodeo clown”, and Ivan does a great job of helping me forget the broken bones, stiffness, and sciatica that go with that territory!</p><cite>Michele R.</cite></blockquote>

Each long flowing stroke is skillful, nurturing, relaxing and therapeutic. Every time after a session with Ivan, I feel rejuvenated and ready to tackle whatever life throws at me! Ivan is an intuitive therapist who knows where the tension is and the right level of touch. Thank you for your healing hands, Ivan!</p><cite>Eros Y.</cite></blockquote>

He has a wonderful sense of touch and deep-pressure techniques. I have always felt comfortable, cared for and safe on his table.

                            <p>Whether it is ordinary tightness in my shoulders and back or pain in my feet, Ivan has helped my body heal. Ivan takes the time to not only listen to me about any issues I'm having, he also explains how he will address them. Aside from ordinary aches and pains, Ivan has helped me with issues as varied as plantar fasciitis and knee pain. I can't handle the bottom of my feet being touched but Ivan used pressure points to help relieve the pain with minimal discomfort to my feet. Recently I explained to Ivan an issue I was having with the back of my knee, not knowing if he could help me or not. Ivan immediately identified the problem and went over how he thought he could help while sharing how that part of the knee works. The pain in the back of my knee, or the "popliteal fossa," as Ivan informed me has had little to no pain since. I am impressed with Ivan's friendliness, professionalism and knowledge and highly recommend him to anybody.</p><cite>Sean S.</cite></blockquote>

Ivan is currently my massage therapist and has been for the last three years because he is consistent in his technique, his availability, and professionalism. I'm apprehensive with who I choose for self-care treatments and after trying several places and people I have always chose to return to Ivan. Over time Ivan has become someone I can trust to be reliable, know his own strength and comprehend the areas that require more attention. Over time he's become like a friend and I appreciate that he is passionate about his work.</p><cite>Amy D.</cite></blockquote>

I first went to Ivan in October 2017 when he was working at Massage Serene and I knew I had found the right therapist for me. Once a month he helps me work through all my lower back pain and the strain it causes on the rest of my body. He is incredibly professional and knowledgeable about massage therapy. Ivan listens to what you're saying and is excellent at explaining how he can address any aches and pains. Ivan always does his best to make you feel welcome, comfortable, and safe.

                            <p>Ivan is the BEST massage therapist I have ever had!  After my longtime massage therapist left my chiropractic office, I searched for over 2 years for someone who met my needs.  I finally found Ivan when he worked at his former location, and I have been happy with him for almost 3 years.  He helped me with a leg injury that I sustained while training for a half marathon, and he consistently relieves the tension and knots in my shoulders, back, and neck that cause frequent migraines.  He applies the right amount of pressure (I need a lot), and he knows how the different parts of the body are interconnected.  My favorite amount of time for a massage with Ivan is 2 hours, and the time flies by.  I am NEVER disappointed when I walk out of Ivan’s massage room, like I have been with other massage therapists before him.  I am so thankful that he chose this line of work!</p><cite>Gina R.</cite></blockquote>

We began trying massage therapy to see if it could help us. Thank goodness we found Ivan! Not only is Ivan a consummate skilled professional, but he also really cares about the whole clients well-being. He provided us with information on how we could help ourselves at home as well. With Ivan as part of our overall ‘healing’ strategy, both of us began making remarkable progress. My husband is back fly fishing and I’m back to laughing and enjoying life. Thanks Ivan.</p><cite>Kathy R.</cite></blockquote>
